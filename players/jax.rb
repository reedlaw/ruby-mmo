# Changes
# v0: How do I shot rat?
# v1: Slaughter rats for that early exp
# v2: Attack low health players to get some KS going
# v3: Refactor with some classes, now that I've patched engine.rb
#     (this better get accepted upstream or I'll have to refactor again...)
# v4: Attack the leader if you've got nothing else going on
# v5: Heal often, cause the posse jumps you at the smell o' blood
# v6: That fool dank has ruined the game for us all.  I tried to mess
#     with his minions a bit.  He still dominates, but others stand a
#     chance now.
# v7: Put the brakes on levelling up to avoid getting ganked early game
